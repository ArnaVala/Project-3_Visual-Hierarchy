# Visual Hierarchy in Design


Visual hierarchy is one of the fundamentals of visual design and refers to the order in which people process the information on a page or screen. It can be seen as a system or design structure to how we prioritize elements on a page that they are easily understood..

The goal of design is to visually communicate a message to users, through words and images. Without paying attention to visual hierarchy in design, it is likely that we fail to convey the message to users - as they can feel frustrated and overwhelmed in finding information.

## Gestalt principles and visual hierarchy

Most rules of visual hierarchy arrive from the Gestalt Principles, which can help in making better decisions in our designs – and how we communicate information to our users effectively.

Gestalt principles are derived from Gestalt Psychology, a theory first introduced by psychologist Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka. The Gestalt psychologist aimed to understand how people gather meaningful information through chaos, and from their research identified a set of laws in how humans inherently try to find order in disorder – or how the mind organizes visual data. According to their findings, the human eye perceives individual elements as a whole, therefore the German word Gestalt – which can be translated to ‘form’, ‘pattern’ or ‘whole’.

The Gestalt principles imply that to make a more effective design, we must understand the concept of totality - that both the individual element and the whole in which it exists are both important, separately and together.

Understanding how these principles work, and how to use them in design, can help crate more engaging and effective work.

Proximity, similarity and repetition are a few of the key Gestalt principles to creating an effective visual hierarchy and grouping of elements.

### Proximity
Proximity is a fundamental principle of composition, which states that elements placed closely appear related. By positioning elements together, we signal to users that those specific elements are related, and belong together - and vice versa we should separate unrelated elements. This makes it easier for them to quickly scan for the information they are looking for, or successfully interact with the interface as intended.

### Similarity
The law of similarity states that elements with a similar visual appearance seem to be related. And just as our mind tends to group similar things together, we also notice things that are dissimilar to a group, so-called anomalies. Our attention is naturally drawn to an anomaly because it is different from everything else.

### Repetition.

Repetition is based on the Gestalt rule Law of Common Region. According to this rule, elements tend to be perceived in groups if they share an area with a clearly defined boundary. Repetition of visual elements creates unity, which improves recognition – and therefore makes it easier for the user to scan a webpage for information.

## Ways to achieve visual hierarchy.

### Size and scale.

Size is a basic but very crucial principle in creating visual hierarchy. Bigger elements draw the viewer’s eye towards a certain area and give elements more importance than others.

In bodies of text, size can be used to draw attention to meaningful subjects, headlines or information. The bigger the more important, it makes it easier for a user to scan quickly and collect information.

### Typographic hierarchy

Typographic hierarchy is a system for organizing type that establishes an order of importance within the data, allowing the reader to easily find what they are looking for and navigate the content. Done right, typography can help guide the reader’s eye to where a section begins and ends, and consistent structure and style of the text throughout a webpage can help the user isolate information quickly.

The simplest way is to define our typography into three different levels:

**Level 1 (Headlines)**
The headlines are the most important content on the page. It’s usually big, bold font that first grabs the users attention.

**Level 2 (Subheadings)**
Level two typography doesn’t stand out as much as level one, but it helps to visually sort the content into different sections. Level two typography is often used for subheadings, which hints to the reader what they are about to read.

 **Level 3 (Body of text)**
Think of level three as the core of your message. If users were interested in your level one and level two typography, they will likely most likely ready level three. This is where you can go into more detail about your product, service, or topic and it’s typically in a smaller font. 

## Color & Contrast.

Colors can be used similarly to size and weight to give importance to elements in your design. Brighter colors are typically going to grab the viewer’s attention much more than dull, non-saturated colours.

To build visual hierarchy with contrast, let the focal points stand out by contrasting their appearance from the other elements of the design. Contrast can be achieved through for example color choice, typeface style, pattern, saturation, and value.

## Texture

Texture in relation to visual hierarchy refers to the overall arrangement or patterns between space, text, images, and other details on a page. They are decorative properties and can give a certain tone and voice to a design, and effect hierarchy by creating visual interest and draw the user’s attention to certain parts of your layout.

## Whitespace

Another way of drawing attention is to give content enough breathing room. Whitespace is the negative space between elements and is an important part of visual design. By arranging elements on your page with enough whitespace you can avoid creating cognitive overload, use it to group elements together or draw attention to them.

## Layout and Alignment

Rules and guides can help in layout of elements of your design. It is easier to align elements or group them with guides, which give a more coherent rhythm, visual hierarchy, balance content and look to a design – which can help the user navigate and grasp the most important information.

There are a few formulas, like the Golden Ratio which can help accomplish this. It can be commonly found in nature and used in classical design theory to create balanced compositions.
